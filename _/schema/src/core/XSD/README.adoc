## XSD Schema & Rules

XSD Schema are derived from components created through the application of CCTS and
UN/CEFACT Modelling Methodology (UMM) process modelling and data analysis. UN/CEFACT XSD
Schema contain XML syntax specific constructs that follow the naming and design rules in this
specification. 

> A CCT is defined as a `xsd:complexType`. Supplementary components are declared as attributes for the CCT `xsd:complexType`. CCTs are contained in the Core Component Type Schema Module which is considered the normative XSD expression of CCTS Core Component Type

The XML fully qualified XPath ties the information to its standardized semantics as described in the underlying CCTS construct and CCTS dictionary entry name, while the XML element or attribute name is a truncation that reflects the hierarchy inherent in the XML construct.

```markdown

[R8] Upper camel case (UCC) MUST be used for naming elements and types.

#### Attribute

<xsd:attribute name="unitCode" .../> 
```
#### Element
```xml
<xsd:complexType name="DespatchAdviceCodeType"> 
```

### Type
```xml
<xsd:complexType name="DespatchAdviceCodeType"> 
```
